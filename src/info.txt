Description of files:
amcl1
    launch 
        start.launch -> starts the amcl localization and all need things for it e.g. lidar fusion and static tfs
    mymap.yaml
    mymap.pgm
fuse
    launch 
        start.launch -> starts lidar fusion which is needed for amcl and gmapping, needs static tfs for it and publishes /scan_multi topic
        which has the front and rear laser points fused together
mapping
    launch
        start.launch -> starts the gmapping, defines the inputs for the gmapping node
    src
        odom.src -> creates the odom -> base_footprint tf for gmapping
        
structure of the tf tree:
map -> odom -> base_footprint -> base_link -> laser_front/laser_rear

name of the bag used to create the map and bags to test:
    to create the map: robotics1_final.bag
    for testing: robotics2_final.bag, robotics3_final.bag
node used for map creation:
    mapping1
description of how to start/use the nodes:
to start gmapping:
    roslaunch mapping start.launch
to save the map:
    rosrun map_server map_saver -f ../mymap
to start amcl localization:
    roslaunch amcl1 start.launch
