Description of files:
amcl1
    launch 
        start.launch -> starts the amcl localization and all need things for it e.g. lidar fusion and static tfs
        start_saver.launch -> starts the map_saver which stores the map as mymap.yaml and myamap.pgm in the amcl1 folder (here)
        this should be done close to the end of the bag to get the best map
    mymap.yaml
    mymap.pgm
fuse
    launch 
        start.launch -> starts lidar fusion which is needed for amcl and gmapping, needs static tfs for it and publishes /scan_multi topic
        which has the front and rear laser points fused together
mapping
    launch
        start.launch -> starts the gmapping, defines the inputs for the gmapping node
    src
        odom.src -> creates the odom -> base_footprint tf for gmapping
        
structure of the tf tree:
map -> odom -> base_footprint -> base_link -> laser_front/laser_rear

name of the bag used to create the map and bags to test:
    to create the map: robotics1_final.bag
    for testing: robotics2_final.bag, robotics3_final.bag
    note: --clock is needed when runing the bag files
node used for map creation:
    mapping1
description of how to start/use the nodes:
1) to start gmapping:
    roslaunch mapping start.launch
2) to save the map:
    roslaunch amcl1 start_saver.launch
3) to start amcl localization:
    roslaunch amcl1 start.launch

generall approach:
    start mapping (see 1)) -> run robotics1_final.bag -> start map saver at the end (see 2))
    stop everything
    start amcl localization (see 3)) -> run other bag files -> open rviz and see the map which is published on topic /map and see the amcl /odom tf 
    or predicted position /amcl_pose
